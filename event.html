            <h1>Gawai Dayak Festival</h1>
            <p>The word 'Gawai', which meaning ritual or festival, comes from the Iban language, wheareas Dayak is the term native used to describe the native ethnic groups of Sarawak, including the Iban, Bidayuh, Kayan, Kenyah, Kelabit, Murut, Lun bawang, and many others.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Gawai Dayak is a time of togetherness, thanksgiving to god and nature for a bountiful harvest, and prayer for a peaceful and happy future. It also marks the conclusion of the padi (rice) harvesting season. Kumang (Queen) and Keling (King) Gawai competitions, Ngirup Ai Pengayu (Long Life Drink), traditional dancing, and general revelry are typical celebration activities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The rural Bidayuh hold the celebration for two days and two nights on weekend in June. Gawai Sowa wasn't always held on weekends in the past,before there were schools. These days, the festivals is held on weekends so that locals, goverment workers, and schoolchildren may all participate in the customary celebration. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Traditionally, the event would be held at any the tukang fawai's (shaman) home. This rather inconvenient and troublesome as his tiny house could hardly accommodate the vast number of visitors. They haven't performed the rituals in individal homes since the 1980s.</p></p>

            <h1>Wedding</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Marriage is the path to become a member in the Bidayuh, granting one the privileges of being a Biik or Ramin. There is exclusively monogamy in the Bidayuh community. Remarriage following a divorce is typical, nevertheless. Marriage outside one's family is a significan custom due to the severe ban on incest. Moreover, cousin marriage is forbidden in the Bidayuh society.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Before entering the world of marriage, passion and the consent of both individuals are highly valued in the Bidayuh society. For fear of rejection and not receiving the right spilt of family assets, both couples will only get married with their approval. But nowdays, both woman and man have theor own rights to choose a life partner regardless of status and family background.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The term "Nakap Babang Siok" is frequently used to describe a bethrothal tie. This is meant to prevent any informal relationships. After reaching a consensus, the engaged parties will have an engagement ceremony, which will be observed by the chief of each village (if the couple from different villages), and both sets of parentswill sign the engagement agreement. The village chief often set the duration of the engagement, and if the couple is still single at the conclusion of the agreement's, the couple is entitled renew the agreement. In the past, marriages were solely consummated in accordance with custom. Religion, culture, and the law all play significant part in determining a couple's legal marriage status. </p>
